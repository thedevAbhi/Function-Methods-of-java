====================================================
java Methods:- block of code performing some action which runs only when it is called.
In the java there are two type of methods:- 1. user defined methods.
                                            2. Standard library methods.
a. Method Signature:-
sum(int a , int b)
Method name + Parameter List is called Method Signature.

b. Access Specifier:-
i.Public ii. private iii. protected iv. default (Static is non access modifier)

c. Return type:-
like int or string or float type which you Return by the function.

d. Method Name:-
in this example "Sum" is the method name.

e. Parameters:-
Parameters are int a, int b.

f. Method Body:-
the code is written in the method 
example:-
sum(int a , int b){
    int cal = a+b;
    sout("The result : "+ cal);
    Return cal;
}

There are two types variables 
1. Static variables (Single copy for Whole class).
2. Instance variables (All objects make there own copy of Instance variable).

=====Standard library Methods=====
1. print():- About the print syntax we all know.
2. sqrt():- Syntax = System.out.println(Math.sqrt());
3. floor():- Syntax = System.out.println(Math.floor()); there is a another syntax 
ceil():- Syntax = System.out.println(Math.ceil());
these three are library defined methods.
=======Packages=======
Collection of similar classes, subclasses , interfaces.
=======Constructor=======
Special method used to initialize objects.
There is two types of constructors : (i) default constructor (ii) Parameterize constructor.
